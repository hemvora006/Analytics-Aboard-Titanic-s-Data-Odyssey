# Analytics-Aboard-Titanic-s-Data-Odyssey

The "Analytics Aboard: Titanic’s Data Odyssey" project is a comprehensive data analytics initiative designed to uncover insights from the famous Titanic dataset while integrating modern data analysis techniques with external contextual information to build a holistic narrative around the Titanic tragedy. This project aims to master data analytics concepts by covering all aspects of data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical modeling, and machine learning. It seeks to enrich the Titanic dataset with additional contextual data such as historical weather conditions, geographical information, and economic indicators. Practical skills in Python and relevant libraries are emphasized for analysis and visualization, with a strong focus on reproducible and scalable workflows. The project’s core features include data collection and integration of original and external datasets, advanced data cleaning and preprocessing techniques, feature engineering to create meaningful predictors, and exploratory data analysis to investigate survival trends across demographics and other factors. Machine learning models will be built and evaluated to predict survival using algorithms like logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, and neural networks, with further exploration into hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation metrics such as F1-score and ROC-AUC.
